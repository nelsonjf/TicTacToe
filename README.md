# TicTacToe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game.  There are two players, X and O.  
The players take turns marking squares in a 3x3 grid with an X or an O respectively. 
The first player to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
Players aim to set up a row while also preventing the other player from getting 3 in a row.  

This game is intended as a local game, having both players at the same computer.  
The controls are intuitive: The player clicks the box they want to mark, and then the second player's turn starts
